# CAMELS-CL

CAMELS-CL is a database developed by Alvarez-Garreton et al., (2018) for large sample studies in the field of hydro-meteorology.

This repository contains examples on how to download and use the dataset and the codes used to compute catchment attributes.

Importantly, we will inform here to the community if there is any update in the database.

CAMELS-CL can be visualised from [https://camels.cr2.cl].
